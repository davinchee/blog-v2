tl;dr

- Got rekt by immigration and Covid-19 so was stuck in limbo
- Decided to answer call to adventure through a self designed experiment
- Set goals that are extremely measurable, they should be determined with: Pass/Fail
- The ideal version of you isn’t something you reach, but it’s a lifestyle you strive towards through your habits, actions and results.

Since April 25th, I have been floating around with a lack of purpose and sense of direction (much like a plastic bag caught in the wind in NYC) in my life as I’m stuck in the U.S., there aren’t many flights going to Malaysia right now due to the whole Coronavirus thing… Let me explain real quick, I did not get selected in the H1B lottery process. My STEM OPT expired on April 25th and I was supposed to leave on June 25th, which I would’ve, but ‘rona! So, I applied for a different visa which would grant me an additional 3 months.

So, given all this time, I am starting to feel an irresistible itch towards action and have been thinking about what the ideal version of myself looks like to me. This is going to be different for everyone, but I believe everyone should strive to improve and be a better version of themselves everyday.

Note: DO NOT compare yourself to others. When you do you usually focus on one dimension: wealth, status, power, attractiveness instead of considering the individual as a whole, so just focus on your stuff, there should be a lot of it. Life is most enjoyable for me when I’m constantly learning, experiencing, growing and evolving as a person.

I realized want to live a life where I can look at myself and what I’m doing and be proud of it, and I’m not currently. So I’ve decided to undertake an experiment. The aim of this experiment has multiple purposes: firstly, to keep myself accountable and disciplined to constantly be striving for a better baseline of results. We should create goals based on results not on a set amount of work. Secondly, because this is an experiment, there will be failures, discoveries and breakthroughs, all of which I want to keep for future reference and use it to improve (a notebook for myself).

If there is only one thing you take away from this all, I want it to be this: Your ideal self is not a destination or an end point, it is a process, a lifestyle. Your actions and behavior dictate who you are, how you will view yourself and how others will view you. The method I plan on testing in my experiment is developing multiple habits which lead me towards who I want to be. In addition to this, I will be setting measurable goals (Pass/Fail) that are tied to my habits and increase in difficulty each week, thus increasing my baseline competence.

I will post a weekly write up on the past weeks goals and how well I did. The write ups will all have the same format in which I reflect on the previous weeks goals. It will include: a quick overview of how many of my goals I passed and failed, the next logical step of my measurable goals for the following week. I will also include notes on everything I’m learning or observing.

So included below are some ways I would describe the ideal version of myself:

relaxed and confident; nice and genuine; generous but firm; constantly curious and learning; constantly measuring/tracking progress; completely cognizant; comfortable in my own skin; well-rounded and balanced; social and lively; purposeful and satisfied; obsessed; resourceful and independent; embracing the struggle; impress myself with my results;

Some of the habits I want to retain to be that ideal version:

exercise (running); meditation; one project a week experiment (link to article on one project a week); reading books; waking up early (6AM); eating healthy; develop a habit that allows creative expression; practice mandarin; write more articles (used to document my learning)\*\*\*; be more social with friends and family; continue to take care of flossing and face hygiene; make my bed in the morning; play less super smash bros; stretch more; start making more money (look for multiple income streams);

So for my first week some of my measurable goals to hit:

- [ ] Remind myself to be curious before doing any activity
- [ ] Wake up early (wake up at 6AM everyday)
- [ ] Make bed everyday
- [ ] Meditate every day for at least 1 minute
- [ ] Exercise every day (go running every day AT LEAST) — run to Gantry State, walk back
- [ ] Stretch after running — Yoga for athletes
- [ ] 1 project per week — will have subgoals which gradually increase the complexity of this project
- [ ] Read before bed every night
- [ ] Start writing at least 1 article a week
- [ ] Do DuChinese — 1 article a day, one day for Chinese, one day for Chinese Hwk

I hope this journey simultaneously helps me improve, but also will be able to used as a template or blueprint for someone else. If you liked this article or want to follow me on my journey, check me out [here](https://vincentkhchee.com/).
