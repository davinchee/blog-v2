tl;dr

- First week was a great start overall
- Failed some goals, but **failure is part of the process**
- Running is definitely a keystone habit for me (habit that aids in other aspects of life/habits) — “**callous**es **the** **mind**”
- Try to use the unproductive part of your brain to convince yourself into being productive
- There is a struggle between making a decision which generates a reward in the short-term vs. long-term
- **You won’t respect yourself if you don’t listen to yourself**
- Adding a new goal and updating the old ones

Score: 11 / 14

So here we are, my first week is complete and I have to say that it feels much better to have some sort of a routine (and accountability to yourself) instead of just watching YouTube and TV all day and playing Super Smash Bros periodically. It feels good to be getting off my ass and doing something! While I view this first week as a good start, I didn’t pass all my goals, and that is 100% OK: **failure is part of the process**.

### Failures

**Wake up early:** I never attempted to do this and decided the night before the week started to instead wake up at 8AM everyday, and I did. I went from sleeping at around 3–5AM every night and waking up between 10AM and 12PM to sleeping earlier and consistently waking up at 8AM every day of this past week.

Although David Goggins would probably call me weak for failing, I believe that the idea of the goal served its purpose-it was a challenge that helped me “callous my mind” (think of how hands get calloused from lifting weights, eventually regrowing thicker skin which is much harder to break through) and maintain a regular, consistent schedule.

Nonetheless, I think I aimed a little too high when I wanted to wake up at 6AM immediately 😅, but I will work towards that in 15–30 minute increments each week.

**Yoga after running:** I couldn’t do this because my leg started cramping when I attempted this on the third day. Maybe I could’ve pushed through it, but that would’ve defeated the purpose of this goal/habit: to enhance my physical performance through flexibility. Attempting to push through that type of pain just doesn’t help. Listen to your body.

**1 Project/week:** This one is interesting because I did complete the base functionality of the project, but I decided that I wanted to change the challenge to a 1 project/biweekly challenge. I have multiple reasons for doing this: it gives me enough time to deploy something I am proud of to the world (I don’t want to rush things) and it allows me to increase the complexity of the projects I want to undertake. However, I do feel like there were a couple of days where I slacked and should’ve worked for longer and I’ll address this in the goal for next week.

While it’s important to set goals, it’s even more important to not lose sight of **why** you’ve created these goals in the first place. Don’t wreck yourself pushing too hard cause that could do more harm than good. Set your goals so they’re just challenging enough so that it’s likely you’ll accomplish them, so you can constantly progress and aim higher. Remember, we’re playing the long game here, it’s a marathon, not a sprint.

### What went well

**Running**: I am pretty happy that I was able to go on a short run [everyday](https://www.dropbox.com/s/gc4vt5x6k15ylu1/116577361_616109349301031_2187513230123582452_n.png?dl=0) this past week. This is amazing because I absolutely fucking hate running and I’ve never ran every single day of the week. My lungs and calves usually start burning once I get halfway to the park (about half a mile), and I won’t lie, there were a couple of instances early in the week where I cheated and walked a bit. But as I got closer to the end of the week, I just push through and the feeling post-run is amazing, both physically and psychologically, especially when you don’t give in at all. Since I detest running, it is a win when I’m done and gets me ready for the challenges that lie ahead in the day. Also, I feel like it gives me a boost of energy.

**Coding**: Although I didn’t complete the 1 project/week challenge, I was able to overcome some obstacles when working and I didn’t stop or give up until I figured out the solution. I was able to create a feeling of unease-that something was incomplete which needed to be completed right now.

Also, I was able to find a bug in Google’s Google Docs API which I submitted and it got assigned. Hopefully, they’ll fix it so I can complete my project, but if not I’ll figure out a workaround.

### Observations

The habits that yielded the greatest benefits in other areas of my life:

\1. Running

Helps build self-discipline, take on challenges for the day, provides boost of energy in morning, quells my morning anxiety.

\2. Waking up earlier/Sleeping enough

Provides the necessary energy for the day, impacts my mood, productivity and quality of life.

\3. Checking in w/ people

This is necessary and helpful especially during a time like now-it’s really refreshing to reconnect with friends you haven’t spoken to or caught up with in a long time.

\4. Coding

Overcoming problems that I get stuck on helps build confidence and the belief that you can solve anything as long as you keep tackling it. Also, this is something which will yield exponential results in the long term.

\5. Meditation

As someone who has high neuroticism, I find meditation to be very helpful in being aware of your own thoughts and recognizing that you are not your thoughts.

Overall, my goals and habits that I’m building are taking me in the right direction and I will continue to build on them. The changes I made in my routine was primarily a change from behaving in ways which generate a short-term reward to engaging in behaviors which lead to long-term reward. For example, making your bed might seem like a silly or annoying thing to do, but you can think of it as sacrificing your time in the present to make your life slightly better in the future (seeing your bed made when you go to sleep).

We are horrible at seeing our future selves as the same person, in fact, we often times don’t even consider them in the equation for our day to day actions. There have been a few [studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5700163/) over the years which show that there is a [struggle](https://pr.princeton.edu/news/04/q4/1014-brain.htm) in making decisions as we are biased by short-term reward seeking behavior. We all go through this internal struggle of choosing instant gratification vs. present sacrifice for long-term gratification. However, the more we partake in challenging activities, the easier it becomes to ignore that voice that is holding you back from your full potential. In fact, I’m already starting to notice that there’s less resistance to get myself to do something difficult.

Remember, **you aren’t going to respect yourself if you won’t/don’t listen to yourself.**

A fun lil’ anecdote:

> When I wake up in the morning I have an anxious feeling immediately and I observe where I feel this: in my chest and stomach. I decided to use this to convince myself that I’ve developed an addiction to running and that I need to go on a run for it to go away (it really goes away when I’m running though) — try to use the part of your brain which convinces you into doing unproductive things to doing productive things.

## Lessons

_Lesson #1 — Failure is a part of the process, just make sure you learn what went wrong and how to grow from it._

_Lesson #2 — Callous your mind by finding a struggle (running is a good one for a lot of people)._

_Lesson #3 — Recognize when you are sacrificing long-term gratification for short-term gratification, try not to, but at the very least be aware._

_Lesson #4 — Learn to talk to yourself and listen to yourself, Jordan Peterson gives a great perspective on this. He says to take the role of a boss and employee of yourself and to act accordingly: negotiate, reward, reprimand, yourself and always be respectful._

_Lesson #5 — Action > Inaction; doing anything, no matter how insignificant is better than doing nothing._

## Week 2 Check In

For the next week, I want to build on some of these habit and change the targets slightly slight increase in difficulty).

I also want to add a new goal: research possible alternative income streams for 30 minutes every day and to have picked something to start working on by the end of the week.

So here are my updated goals for the following week:

- [ ] Wake up consistently and sleep at least 8 hours a night (wake up between 7:30–45AM everyday)
- [ ] Make bed everyday
- [ ] Meditate every day for at least 2 minutes
- [ ] Exercise every day, run at least 1 mile and start doing upper body workout (start drinking protein shake w/ creatine to aid recovery for extra activity)
- [ ] Stretch after running — Yoga for athletes on none upper body days
- [ ] 1 project per two weeks — Code for at least 6 hours a day
- [ ] Read before bed every night for 5 minutes
- [ ] Start writing at least 1 article a week — submit story to “The Innovation”
- [ ] Do DuChinese — 1 article a day, one day for Chinese, one day for Chinese Hwk
- [ ] Watch YouTube less while coding (can use while writing) — 2 hours/day
- [ ] Send a text to immediate family and friends everyday
- [ ] Face routine and floss everyday
- [ ] Play less smash — 1 hour/day max
- [ ] Start researching alternative income streams for 30 minutes a day — should have decided on something to start working on by end of week

I hope that in the future when I stumble upon these posts, I recognize this as a positive turning point in my life.
