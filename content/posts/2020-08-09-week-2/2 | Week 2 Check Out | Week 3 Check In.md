# TIY: Week 2 Check Out | Week 3 Check In

> “A difficult lesson to learn: Your most persistent distractions will seem justified to you.” — James Clear

------

I plan on changing the format for the series slightly: I will provide a  quick summary of the lessons learned this week, the week 2 check out,  the week 3 check in and then some notes/personal observations at the  very bottom.

## Lessons

*Lesson #1 — Utilize incentives-embrace human nature!*

- I feel like I didn’t stress this enough before, but be nice to yourself  and use incentives to get yourself to do things. When trying to pick up  new habits/get better results, it’s extremely effective to use some sort of incentive to condition yourself to do things. Try to Pavlov  yourself!

*Lesson #2 — Always be asking: Am I pushing myself hard enough? (as you develop the habit).*

- It is OK to only “show up” at the very beginning when developing a habit,  but as your habits start to stick and you feel like you’re going through the motions, ask yourself how you can push yourself a bit more.

*Lesson #3 — Conversely, also ensure that you aren’t pushing yourself too hard, and take breaks, burnout sucks*

- We want consistency, so don’t overexert, this applies especially when it  comes to the body. e.g. to build endurance for running: run at a pace  where you can talk. It is also important to take breaks when you feel  tired. I don’t feel tired yet, so I’m just gonna keep running a mile a  day, but faster.

*Lesson #4 — Split habits into maintenance habits/growth habits.*

- The habits I have been carrying out can be split into two groups: maintenance and growth.
- Maintenance habits are those that are the static things in my life, they aren’t  things that need to be improved upon to get the full results. For  example, it doesn’t make sense to keep improving on making my bed.
- Growth habits/goals on the other hand are dynamic. You should constantly be  trying to set goals that are increasingly difficult week after week.

*Lesson #5 — Don’t sacrifice who you could be for who you are.*

- Recognize that when you want to improve or be better that there are certain  aspects of your self/habits/activities that you have to let go of, and  this may be difficult especially if you consider any of these as an  integral part of your identity. While it is painful, it is a necessary  step.

# Week 3 Check In

For the next week, I want to continue building upon my growth habits,  increasing the difficulty a bit. I’ve added some more specific results  for a few of the goals because it felt like it targeted the intent of  the habit more and would help yield results more effectively. I want to  keep all the maintenance habits and also add a few which may aid with my growth habits.

**Maintenance Habits**
- [ ] Make bed everyday
- [ ] Watch YouTube less while coding (can use while writing) — 2 hours/day
- [ ] Send a text to immediate family and friends everyday
- [ ] Face routine and floss everyday
- [ ] Play less smash — 1 hour/day max
- [ ] Stretch after running — Yoga on none upper body days
- [ ] Start writing at least 1 article a week
- [ ] Take protein + creatine, vitamins
- [ ] Turn off all devices/lights by 10:30PM
- [ ] Write down any todo’s on a central todo app: Todoist

**Growth Habits**
- [ ] Wake up consistently and sleep at least 8 hours a night (wake up between 7:00–7:30AM everyday)
- [ ] Run at least one mile under 8:30, set a PR this week at least once, upper body workout, abs workout
- [ ] 1 project per two weeks — code for at least 6 hours/day AND learn how to do one new thing every day
- [ ] Read before bed every night for 15 minutes
- [ ] Do DuChinese — 1 article a day, one day for Chinese, one day for Chinese Hwk
- [ ] Meditate every day for at least 5 minutes

# Personal Notes

## Goods

- Running is so damn key. Keep starting the day with this. Forever.
- Keep stretching and doing recovery, this is gonna be especially important as I’m getting older.
- Keep meditating, the place you go to when you meditate can be reached on command more easily with practice.

## Fails + Solutions

- Wasn’t able to sleep 8 hours, had many nights of 6–7 hours, kept sleeping late => this is not good, it impacted some of my runs
- Solution: Try to have a better wind down routine. Turn off all devices/lights by 10:30PM.
- Was unable to code for 6 hours a day and didn’t finish the project, I kept  getting distracted and was inefficient when it came to busywork (booking flight out of the US)
- Solution: Track your time next week by 1-hour blocks and see what you’re spending your time on. Also, allocate blocks of time for coding only.
- Working Blocks: 10AM-12PM, 1PM-5PM (daily except Wednesday)
- Totally forgot that I needed to submit a past story to “The Innovation” publication 😅
- Solution: Will start using the [Todoist](https://todoist.com/r/kwuan_chee_jbwcgp) app for writing down some specific tasks in the future
- Didn’t spend enough time thinking of different ways of to make some extra cash
- Solution: There are only so many broad categories, pick one and start  implementing how you would carry it out-the project/idea which interests you the most: pick that one.
