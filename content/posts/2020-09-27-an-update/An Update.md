Hello again world!

I have not been writing for the last month or so because I realized that my priorities weren't properly optimized. While self-improvement was and still is important to me, I realized I was somewhat neglecting the fact that my time in NYC was limited and more importantly the time I had with the people I loved in NY was limited. So I stopped adhering to the general self-improvement schedule I implemented to get myself active and doing things again.

However, I decided to maintain a regular running schedule (5x/wk) while carrying out the other activities whenever it made sense. For example, I still coded infrequently and charted and made a few trades here and there (if my girlfriend was doing work for her internship or homework for school for example). My new goal for the last month was to spend as much quality time with her and my friends and to have a couple of last-hurrah get togethers with my closest friends in the city. People often say that NYC is the greatest city in the world and while I do think it is an awesome city, it is the people you know in a city which truly makes it the best city.

I am very happy with the way I spent my final weeks in New York, that is, with the people I love. I noticed that it almost sounds like I'm writing about this as if I died, which is true in a way, my chapter in NY and the US has concluded as of now. I think the lesson here is that while I may not have been super productive in my final weeks, it is important to remain balanced in life and to recognize when to take your foot off the gas and to just cruise.

This past year has been the most difficult and shitty year of my life. Here's a list of some of the highlights of shit:

- I was in Puerto Rico when the earthquake happened and the last 2 days of our trip were without electricity. Not to mention I mentally prepared myself for death when it actually occurred (I had no idea if the structural integrity of the building I was staying in was sufficient).
- One of my favorite human beings and idols growing up passed away: Kobe Bryant
- I lost my first job due to no more runway
- Corona.
- I didn't get my H1B, which meant losing my second job, which I got about a month after losing my first job. Oh, and also having to uproot my life and leave everything behind.

While all this shit happened, I remain grateful and generally optimistic. I am grateful to have had the opportunity to travel to PR with my girlfriend and have an extremely enjoyable trip overall. I am grateful that I was able to meet Kobe Bryant one time and to have him as inspiration for so many things in my life over the years. I am grateful that I had the opportunity to work at my first job where I made one of my closest friends and also gained valuable work experience and learned a lot about myself and what type of person I need to be. I am grateful that the people I love are healthy and that I am healthy as well. I am also grateful that I was fortunate to be able to sustain myself and the same standard of living for 5 months in NYC without unemployment checks. I am grateful that I had the opportunity to live in the greatest city in the world, experience a bunch of crazy shit that the city has to offer, meet a bunch of really awesome people and to have met my girlfriend and experience two wonderful years with her. Alas, the journey had to continue.

The trip back from New York was a long and arduous one. I flew from JFK to HIA, had a short stop over there then continued to KLIA (7 hour layover for enough time for test results) and went through the Corona screening and tested negative for Corona so that I could transit to my final destination in BKI. The whole journey lasted around 40 hours, the best way to describe the state of my brain during this trip: wobbly.

Nothing prepares you for such a dramatic shift in your life especially when it isn't your decision and while I was able to somewhat ignore the reality back in NY, now that I'm here living that reality I have no choice but to face my new situation head on and to ADAPT. Currently, I am on my third day of quarantine and while I haven't gone completely crazy yet, I definitely feel like I'm starting to get a little bit antsy from time to time and would really appreciate to go outside for a little walk. Being in America for seven years has certainly made me become more Americanized-this was very telling by my initial reaction when I initially found out that I had to quarantine for two weeks! My main struggle is trying to overcome jetlag while being stuck indoors, not the easiest, would not recommend.

Some of the things that I'm doing to keep myself busy during the quarantine/maintain my mental and physical health:

- Meditation (so you can get out of your thoughts when you start getting into them)
- Video/Voice call with at least one person everyday
- Yoga + foam rolling and exercise (upper body and jump rope)
- Drink lots of water
- Daily showers
- Read
- Coding/Working on whatever your craft is
- Some super smash
- YouTube/Instagram/Netflix: mellow out time to just relax

Although I have faced a lot of adversity this year and my life has changed drastically, I am simultaneously sad that I am longer in the US, but also excited for what other opportunities are on the other side.
