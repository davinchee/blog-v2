Let’s jump straight into it.

Lessons

_Lesson #1 — Put out positive vibes._

- This is something that I have realized that I don’t do nearly enough. I don’t go around spreading negative energy, however I don’t make a conscious enough effort to spread positive energy. If anything I likely have a very monotone and dull energy.

_Lesson #2 — Plan your life via a 10 year plan._

- This past week I have had several conversations with friends discussing what I will be doing after I leave NY in September and to be honest I haven’t really thought much about it. I am focused on improving and learning, but I still don’t have a sense of direction.
- I think it is important to think about where you want to be on a longer term timeframe because it can be very easy to get caught up in short term cycles and you never

- Continued learning TA and will stick w/ crypto now

Bads+Solution

- Didn’t do so well with the sleep, but part of that was due to hanging out with friend so I’m totally fine with this! Still was consistent 5/7 days
- Things to focus more on: reading, mandarin, crypto TA
- - Solution: I have scheduled my day into blocks and I will be using a modified version of the Pomodoro technique to tackle the larger chunks of the day

Week 5 Check In

So I hit most of my maintenance habits last week and the only one I broke was turning of lights at 10:30, but that’s because I was out! Totally fine to spend some nights out later than normal, as long as it’s not the majority of the week. For the next week, I want to really focus on figuring out my long-term plan, my ten-year plan if you will. I will do this by going over the Build a Life course on Mark Manson’s website. I will allocate one hour a day (30 minutes from coding time/30 minutes from crypto/ta time) until I finish the course and have a better idea of what steps I should be taking to get where I want to. I also plan to test out my schedule to see if it leads to more output. Also, didn’t do the sprint workout, wanted to focus more on running, I was able to do around 1.75-2mi/day so not too bad.
