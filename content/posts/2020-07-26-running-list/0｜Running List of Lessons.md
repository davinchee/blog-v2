A running list of lessons from the TIY series: a condensed version of the main points/lessons learned. This list will be updated each week and may be edited/refined as I progress and gather more data. ðŸ¤“

Some of the lessons may include a brief explanation of the fundamental lesson. Hopefully you will find at least one of these thoughts useful.

> The ideal version of you isnâ€™t something you reach, but itâ€™s a lifestyle you strive towards through your habits, actions and results.

- You are not what you say you are or think you are, you are what you **do**.

> Once you have an idea of what an ideal version of you looks like, set measurable short-term goals (Pass/Fail) which enable you to take actions which your ideal self takes

- You should be able to build upon and increase difficulty over time.

> Failure is a part of the process

- Just make sure you learn what went wrong and how to grow from it.

> Never stop learning and never stop struggling

- Without a struggle, there is no meaning, without meaning, there is no joy. A worthy struggle is good.
- Donâ€™t forget to constantly remind yourself/ask yourself to push yourself.
- But not too hard, we want consistency, also itâ€™s important to take breaks

> Speaking of struggling: Callous the mind => running is useful, not many people like running

- This is useful because life is gonna throw all types of shit your way, best to get used to it and be mentally prepared

> Donâ€™t get too caught up in the goal to the point where you lose sight of the original reason for setting the goal

- Look back at the ideal version of yourself in the past, see if you are carrying those ideals-if not, ask yourself if itâ€™s because youâ€™ve lost sight of your goals or because you this is no longer an important value for you.

> Do not compare yourself with others, life is too short for that bullshit

- The only person you should be comparing yourself with is (ding! ding! ding!) yourself: when you go to sleep is that version of you slightly better than the one who woke up this morning?

> Learn to talk to yourself and listen to yourself, Jordan Peterson gives a great perspective on this. He says to take the role of a boss and employee of yourself and to act accordingly: negotiate, reward, reprimand, yourself and always be respectful.

- Utilize incentives to reward yourself at the end of a day of good work, but be strict, only after you do good work and donâ€™t reward more than you originally agreed upon.

> You wonâ€™t respect yourself if you donâ€™t listen to yourself

- Our long-term decision making is often skewed by short-term reward seeking behaviors: if you never listen to the needs of your future self in the present, your future self wonâ€™t like you
- Recognize when you are sacrificing long-term gratification for short-term gratification, try not to, but at the very least be aware.

> Action > Inaction; doing anything, no matter how insignificant is better than doing nothing.

- Donâ€™t get stuck with analysis paralysis, where you overthink before acting, just start acting and youâ€™ll figure it out along the way, itâ€™s better than staying still

> Try to categorize your habits based on whether they are things that need maintaining or constant iteration and change

- Certain habits yield the most value when they remain constant (brushing teeth) and some when they are constantly changing (working out)

> Donâ€™t sacrifice who you could be for who you are.

- You need to allow parts of yourself to die to give room for who you want to be.

> Implement some sort of data collection system for your life.

- Without data, how do you know youâ€™re moving in the right direction? We are becoming less and less self-aware because of how much we rely on our phones to make decisions for us.

> Adaptability is the most important skill.

- Adaptability is key for thriving in any environment as the only constant is that the environment is constantly changing. The ability to adapt to your environment requires quick learning and quick and effective learning requires critical thinking and proper information filters.

> Be mindful.

- If youâ€™re anything like me, you can get caught up in a routine/task and forget about yourself for a while. Meditate and try to remind yourself to be mindful throughout the day.

> Only use what is useful for you.

- Try out other peopleâ€™s ideas, but if they donâ€™t work, it is possible that it isnâ€™t useful for you as an individual. Donâ€™t try to force information when itâ€™s unhelpful.

> Be multidimensional.

- While it is important for me to find something to get very obsessed about to work on, it is just as important to try to strike a balance. Good people who have your back are key and challenging yourself by learning different things (that you arenâ€™t usually interested in) is also important.
