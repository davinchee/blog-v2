Ever since losing my job, I have a lot more time to learn, a lot! I have realized that I need to start learning more, adding to my knowledge portfolio in depth and breadth and start actually building things. The end goal is to build something that people need, but for now I want to get into the habit of building things and learning along the way. I like taking a hands-on and results oriented approach to this experiment/challenge. Building things and struggling is the fastest, most effective and fun way to learn, at least for me.

Another reason for starting this challenge and writing it down is to provide myself a collection of notes of simple how to do knowledge, gotchas and things to avoid, tricks. I also want to ensure that my understanding is deep, this may require me to be extra curious about certain areas I wouldn’t have bothered to explore before. It requires true knowledge to explain a technical concept to someone with no technical background, seriously, try it with something you think you understand very well. A few things I want to keep in mind:

- constantly improve and increase project complexity OR learn new area (depth OR breadth)
- a collection of all the skills I learned

I will include a write up at the start of each week and will outline the project I plan to undertake as well as a reflection of the previous weeks project. I’ll detail what I learned and evaluate how successful it was. Also, as the weeks go by I will also evaluate on how effective the learning method is and if I need to tweak the process in any way. I **MUST** have an anything is possible attitude, that’s the only way I’m gonna grow the way I need to.

So lets dive right into the first project I will create, a full-stack blog site which will include these features:

- home page => shows the collection of series (different organized collections of posts)
- about page => includes a brief explanation of the reason for the creation of the site
- contact page => includes a bunch of different ways to reach out to me about whatever.
- google doc templates to html
- would like to be able to pass in a google doc url, and it renders the doc as html
- should take into account bold, underline, etc.
- would like to have an excel spreadsheet of google doc urls, when I add it there, it renders the docs in the order added
- authentication => people can sign up to comment

Primary goals

- learn how to create a full-stack web application
- deploy the frontend, backend, DB
- nifty stuff with Google Docs/Sheets
- login authentication on the backend using the Gorilla Toolkit

Secondary goals

- HTTPS
- Sign up with OAuth
- Confirm email
- Adding a testing suite
- Deploying the testing suite onto something like CircleCI
- Add some google analytics to see stats on the site
- Figure out some common security vulnerabilities to fix
- Figure out optimization of website, after initial load on someone’s browser, we should store the data somewhere, so subsequent visits in same session don’t require a load

I believe that the primary goals will be done early in the week and that I will be able to get into some of the secondary goals. Would love to hear about any project ideas you have!
